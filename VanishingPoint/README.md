The code aims to  preview the vanishingPonit of a image, I use Gaussian filter, Canny algorithm to generate Edge,
Hough transfunction to fing lines, in a result, I find the VanishingPoint with RANSAC and Least square method.

Besides, you can test your prior point with real point in vanishingPoint.csv.
